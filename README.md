<h1>Example Code from my Article</h1>
Hello!
If you're here, you're probably looking for the example code from my How-to-Geek article on Building a Simple To-Do List in Python. <br>
The Python code here is freely available to anyone who wants to check it out. It's also properly commented, so you can follow along with what I did. To get the code:<br>
1. Hit the Code button on the top right of the repository description. <br>
2. Hit "Download Zip".<br>
3. Unzip the folder and open up the Python file in the code editor of your choice.<br>
I hope you find this enlightening. If you spot some problems or errors, and would like to reach out to me, feel free! <br>
