<h1>Example Code from my Article</h1>
Hello!
If you're here, you're probably looking for the example code from my How-to-Geek article on Building a Simple To-Do List in Python. <br>
The Python code here is freely available to anyone who wants to check it out. It's also properly commented, so you can follow along with what I did. To get the code:<be>
1. Hit the Code button on the top right of the repository description.
2. Hit "Download Zip".
3. Unzip the folder and open up the Python file in the code editor of your choice.
I hope you find this enlightening. If you spot some problems or errors, and would like to reach out to me, feel free! <br>
